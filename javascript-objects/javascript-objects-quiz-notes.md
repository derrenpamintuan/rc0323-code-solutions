## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are objects used for?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.

- What are object properties?
If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.

- Describe object literal notation.
The object is the curly braces and their contents, store that into a variable of the preferred name, contains key value pairs which are separated by using a colon, and separate each property and method with a comma (but not after the last value).

- How do you remove a property from an object?
Use the keyword delete on the object, and then use dot notation to identify the property you want to remove from the object.

- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
By using dot notation and square brackets. When updating, use assignment operator to assign it a different value.
