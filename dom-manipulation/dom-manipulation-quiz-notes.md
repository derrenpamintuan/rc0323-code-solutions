## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
Property used to get and set the value of the class attribute of the specified element. Its value is a string variable representing the class of the current element.

- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
Use the className property after the element and assign it to a new string.

- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
Property used to collect or update the text that is in the containing element (and its children).

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
Use the textContent property after the element and assign it a new string.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
Yes, to let you know about the event that happened.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
More complicated because how will you store the values of a counter.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
It is easier to access the information if you are going to use it again.
