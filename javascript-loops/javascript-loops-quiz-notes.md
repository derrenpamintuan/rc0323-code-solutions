## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
Is used to loop until the counter reaches a specified number.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
Each single pass through the sequence to complete all the steps in the given order is known as an iteration.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
An expression evaluated before each pass through the loop.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
It is evaluated once before the loop begins.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
It is evaluated before each loop iteration.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
It is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration. This occurs before the next evaluation of condition.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
The keyword break is used to exit a loop before its condition evaluates to false.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
One is added to the counter using the increment operator.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
By using a for in loop.
