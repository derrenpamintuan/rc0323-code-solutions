## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSX?
 A syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.

 Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
 Each react component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use JSX to represent that markup.

 JSX looks lot like HTML, but it is a bit more strict and can display dynamic information.
