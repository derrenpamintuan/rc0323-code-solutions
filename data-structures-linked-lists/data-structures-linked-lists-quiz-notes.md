# data-structures-linked-lists-notes

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How are linked lists different from an array?
 A linked list is a concrete data structure consisting of a bunch of value-containing "nodes" strung together into a single, sequential list.

 Linked lists are sequential access (like a queue), not random access (like an array).

- How would you access an arbitrary node in a linked list (not just the "head")?
 Start from the “head” node and use the .next property until you reach that certain node.
