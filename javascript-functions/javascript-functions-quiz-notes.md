## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
A set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
First, the function keywoord followed by an optional name.
Second, a comma separated list of 0 or more parameters that is surrounded by parenthesis.
Third, the start of the functions code block which is indicated by the opening curly brace '{'.
Fourth, an optional return statement.
Lastly, The end of the functions code block indicated by the closing curly brace '}'.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
The name of the function followed by parenthesis of 0 or more arguments.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
Function keyword, opening curly brace for the code block, definition of the function, closing curly brace for the end of the code block.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
Function parameters are listed inside the parenthesis '()' in the function definition. Function arguments are values received by the function when it is called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
They are similar to a placeholder, it is basically a variable whose value is unknown until we call the function and pass an argument.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
It causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program, and prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
