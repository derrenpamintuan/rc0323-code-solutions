## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
( == ) equal to, ( != ) not equal to, ( === ) strictly equal to,
( !== ) strictly not equal to, ( > ) greater than, ( < ) less than,
( >= ) greater than or equal to, ( <= ) less than or equal to.

- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
Returns a boolean data type value of true or fasle.

- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
The if statement evaluates (or checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.

- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
No, else is not required to use an if statement. However, if statements only run if the condition is true. If else statements run whether the condition is true or false.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
Begin with keyword if, followed by a condition wrapped in parenthesis, followed by an opening curly brace, followed by some code to execute if the value is true, followed by the closing curly brace.

- What are the three logical operators?
( && ) logical AND, ( || ) logical OR, ( ! ) logical NOT.

- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
Use parenthesis to enclose the whole comparison expression, then inside those parenthesis wrap the expressions inside another set of parenthesis, followed by that is the comparison operator, and the next set of expressions wrapped inside another set of parenthesis.

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression’s values against a series of case clauses, and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression’s value.

- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
No, a default clause is optional in a switch statement.
