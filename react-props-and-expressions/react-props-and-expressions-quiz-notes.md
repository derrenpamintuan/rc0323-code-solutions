## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are props in React?
 They are similar to HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

- How do you declare and access props in a component?
 Inside the JSX component tag, you can declare a prop such as a CSS property and assign it a value according to the prop.

 To access them, pass them inside the parameters surrounded by curly braces (if multiple props, separate them with commas) of the defining component. This lets you use them inside your component.

- How do you pass props to a component?
 Add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes.

- How do you write JavaScript expressions in JSX?
 You can write JavaScript expressions inside of curly braces.
