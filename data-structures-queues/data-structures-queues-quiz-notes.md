## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the acronym FIFO mean?
 First-in-first-out: the first thing enqueued onto the queue is the first thing that can be dequeued out.

- What methods are available on a Queue data structure?
 enqueue() - adds a value to the “back” of the queue
 dequeue() - removes the “front” value from the queue and returns it
 peek() - returns the “front” value of the queue without removing it

- What must you do to access the value at an arbitrary point in a queue (not just the "front")?
 Remove the value with dequeue() and when you get to that specific point, check the value with peek().
